This is the skeleton template repository for Skytable's NodeJS driver. You can [track the implementation here](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/issues/324)!

Tasks:
- [ ] Implement a basic Skytable client driver for NodeJS
- [ ] Functionality:
  - [ ] Implement the full Skyhash protocol
  - [ ] Be able to send and receive queries and decode them ergonomically (into appropriate objects and/or types)
  - [ ] Should have a way to use TLS
